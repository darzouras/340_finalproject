Changes made to be double checked:
* Games can now be added to the Games table!
* General Queries: Characters can be looked up by their homelands via drop-down menu (we could change this to a text box!!!)
* General Queries: Games can be looked up by release systems via drop-down menu (also can change to text box)
* characters.php -> Update and delete forms were fitted with drop-down lists of names that exist in the database.
